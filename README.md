## Description

This project include data analyses from my research with middle school students, how they view themselves in the context of music (music self-concept) and theirs beliefs about the nature of music ability (mindset of music ability). Middle school students from three schools in the Southern United Stated completed a survey containing measures of music self-concept, mindset of music ability, active engagement in music-related activities, and sociodemographic variables. Raw dataset (without identifiable data) is available upon request.
